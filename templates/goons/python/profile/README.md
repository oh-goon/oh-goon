# python/profile

Profile the project’s pytest workload with Pyinstrument and retain evidence of the HTML report.

**Status:** runnable with prerequisites. **Effects:** Executes and profiles the real pytest workload.

**Prerequisites:** The selected locked group must supply pytest and Pyinstrument.

**What to edit / settings owner:** select caller values in your workflow `run.yml`. [`goon.yml`](goon.yml) owns input types/defaults, Steps, requirements, effects and outputs. Select this capability through a Plan; use [the common setup and customization guide](../../../README.md) for inspect → validate → lock → run.

**Expected outputs:** `pytest-profile.html`, retained as evidence.

**Failures:** invalid bindings reject before work; native failures, missing capabilities and incomplete execution retain their actual Step/Run status. Configuration validation alone proves no successful effect.

**Customize:** change caller inputs in `run.yml`; use ordinary `with:`/`pass:` bindings and ordered imports in a project Plan/Composite for structural changes. Native tools keep their own configuration.

## Before you run

The selected locked group provides `pyinstrument`, `pytest` and any plugins required by project configuration.

## Configure and compose

`project` selects the repository-relative uv project directory; `dependency_group` selects its locked tools. Commands run from that project by default, so native configuration, tests and report paths follow the same selection. Defaults are `.` and `dev`. Set the caller choices in `run.yml` as shown in the [template guide](../../../README.md#change-values-without-editing-the-goon).

Add `python/profile` to a Plan’s ordered `goons:` list with a plain import to keep its defaults. Unique public inputs are available to caller values automatically. Use `with:` for fixed choices or dataflow; use `pass:` when shared names need explicit recipients. Refresh the lock with the same values before running.

## Result and extension

`pytest-profile.html` is written in the selected project. Local runs leave it there for viewing; evidence records its hash and size, rather than retaining its bytes after an isolated workspace is disposed. Pytest policy remains active while profiling.

Append another Goon to the Plan to add a capability. To change this command sequence, create a project-owned Atomic Goon and import it with an explicit `from:` source. See [authoring and local imports](../../../README.md#append-your-own-capability).

See [artifact retention](../../../../docs/development/TEMPLATE_ARTIFACT_RETENTION.md) for Run evidence and retained content.
